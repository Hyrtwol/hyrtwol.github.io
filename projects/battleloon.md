## Prison rules

* Head and body shot equals death.
* One arm means only pistol.
* One leg mean no move.
* Lead shoos to keep the balloons down (tr√¶sko)
* Suicide by taking of off the shoos and float to the sky.

* With each kill the head is inflated a bit, making the avatar a slightly bigger target.
* Self inflicted head pop by inflation equals round won!

1. Pin (melee one handed)
2. Pistol (one handed)
