# Delphi

Over the year i've been coding a lot in Delphi, was lucky enough to skip the first version for windows 3.1 and started with with version 2 with 32 bit support. The last version i used was Delphi 7.2 mostly because i didn't like the IDE that came after. I more or less stopped coding in pascal because i had to learn C# but that's another story.

After being away from Delphi for 10 years or so i took it for a spin again to see how it works with windows 8, it was again version 7. It was nice to be back, spend many hours in that IDE, i think it was the last version having the floating toolbars but they showed up fine, only looked a bit funny in the new preview in windows 8. A nice thing Delphi have always been compiling fast but on a modern PC it's more less instant.
