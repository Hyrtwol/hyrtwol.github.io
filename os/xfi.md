## Windows 7

Confirmed to be working on Windows 7 Professional SP1 64-bit.

Don't use later versions it will only make trouble, must say the drivers for this card is a bit shaky :(

Before installing run the [Driver Sweeper](http://www.guru3d.com/content_page/guru3d_driver_sweeper.html) tool from Guru3D to wipe old or newer Creative drivers.

On two occasions now the card stopped working after changing other hardware
(last time i added a harddisk and removed a dvd-drive!?) i suspect the 
[IRQ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt_request) or port address, but i'm absolutely not sure.
But resetting the plug'n'play settings in the BIOS helped the first time.
A complete reinstall helped the second time...

After installation uninstall the autoupdater no need for that, more safe to update manually for now.
